# The "sensor" Repository
This repository contains all files related to the smart sensors that were created for the TinyAIoT project seminar. For an explanation of these sensors, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/tinyaiot-ps/sensor/wiki) of this repository. The following table explains its top-level directory structure.

| File / Directory | Description |
|-|-|
| `lorawan_antenna` | An experimental Arduino sketch for testing and learning about LoRa and associated libraries. It uses the [senseBox LoRa Bee](https://docs.sensebox.de/docs/hardware/bee/lora-bee/) which is incompatible with the LoRa board used in the smart trash bins. |
| `trash_bin` | The Arduino sketch for our smart trash bins. Refer to the wiki for details about its structure. |
| `wiki` | A directory for resources used in the wiki. |
| `README.md` | This file. |

**TODO: add relevant files for smart noise detector**
